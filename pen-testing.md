- [Penetration](penetration.md)
- Variously known as Pen Testing, Penetration Testing or Ethical Hacking
- A security evaluation used to actively test the external perimeter of a computer system, network or Web application in order to find vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit so these weak spots can be resolved before they can be exploited. #ref/2023/12/09/124901 #ref/2023/12/09/101428 #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary

- Employs a combination of automated tools and manual exploitations performed by security and attack experts. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
- This is an advanced form of security assessment that should only be used by environments with a mature security infrastructure. A penetration test will use the same tools, techniques and methodologies as criminal hackers, and thus, it can cause downtime and system damage. However, such evaluations can assist with securing a network by discovering flaws that are not visible to automated tools based on human (i.e. social engineering) or physical attack concepts. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
