- Cyber security is a particular type of information security that focuses on the protection of electronic data held and processed on digital systems, against unauthorised access, damage or misuse. It includes the protection of the hardware, software and associated infrastructure, the data that is held, and the services provided, and encompasses both technical and non-technical defence mechanisms. The term is often used to refer to information security generally because most data breaches involve network or system intrusion. #ref/2023/12/09/095245 #glossary 

- Cyber security is defined by [ITU-T Recommendation X.1205](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.1205-200804-I). #ref/2023/12/09/095245

- Steganography|Methods of hiding the existence of a message or other data. This is different than cryptography, which hides the meaning of a message but does not hide the message itself. An example of a steganographic method is "invisible" ink. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
