# Advanced Persistent Threat
- A stealthy and sophisticated security breach that enables an attacker to gain access or control over a system for an extended period of time, often with the intent to steal data or assets #ref/2023/12/09/130055 #ref/2023/12/09/120659  #glossary

- Often an [APT](apt.md) takes advantage of numerous unknown vulnerabilities or zero day attacks, which allow the attacker to maintain access to the target even as some attack vectors are blocked. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
- Both private and governmental organisations are targeted for both political or financial motives. Groups that pose an APT risk are typically nation-state sponsored, with the capability, intent and resources to conduct a long-term campaign against a targeted entity. #ref/2023/12/09/120659
