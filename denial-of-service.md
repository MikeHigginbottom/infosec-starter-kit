# Denial Of Service
- A malicious attempt to disrupt or block access to and use of the normal traffic of a targeted [server](server.md), service or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic. #ref/2023/12/09/124901  It is a violation of [availability](availability.md). #ref/2023/12/09/130055 #glossary

- General approach is to bombard a system with connections to keep it so busy that it is unable to accept legitimate connections. #ref/2023/12/09/095245
- A flooding attack sends massive amounts of network traffic to the target overloading the ability of network devices and [servers](server.md) to handle the raw load. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
- A connection exhaustion attack repeatedly makes connection requests to a target to consume all system resources related to connections, which prevents any other connections from being established or maintained. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
- A resource demand attack repeatedly requests a resource from a [server](server.md) in order to keep it too busy to respond to other requests. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
