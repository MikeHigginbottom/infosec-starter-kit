# Internet of Things
- The network of devices and objects that can connect to the Internet. This includes devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and servers, but also is starting to extend to transport, buildings and household items like doorbells, thermostats, lightbulbs and toys. In a healthcare setting this can also include examples such as patient monitoring and asset tracking. This represents a major security challenge as any device can potentially be a target or conduit for an attack and remediation will be difficult to implement. #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary
