# Two Step Authentication
- A means of authentication commonly employed on websites as an improvement over single factor authentication but not as robust as [multi factor authentication](multi-factor-authentication.md). This form of authentication requires the visitor provide their username (i.e. claim an identity) and password (i.e. the single factor authentication) before performing an additional step. The additional step could be receiving a text message with a code, then typing that code back into the website for confirmation. Alternatives include receiving an e-mail and needing to click on a link in the message for confirmation, or viewing a pre-selected image and statement before typing in another password or PIN. Two-step is not as secure as two-factor because the system provides one of the factors to the user at the time of logon rather than requiring that the user provide both. #ref/2023/12/09/130055 #glossary
