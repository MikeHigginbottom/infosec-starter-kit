- In the field of information security, SIEM is used to provide real-time analysis of security events and alerts generated by network hardware, operating system and applications. SIEM solutions are generally used to consolidate logs from multiple ICT assets and syslog servers into one system. Anomalies and security events/alerts can be detected across an ICT estate in real time, which can then be investigated and responded to by security analysts. #ref/2023/12/09/120659
- A formal process by which the security of an organization is monitored and evaluated on a constant basis. SIEM helps to automatically identify systems that are out of compliance with the security policy as well as to notify the IRT (Incident Response Team) of any security violating events. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
