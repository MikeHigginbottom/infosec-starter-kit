# Due Diligence
- Similar to [Due Care](due-care.md), due diligence is the requirement that organizations must develop and deploy a protection plan to prevent fraud, abuse, and additional deploy a means to detect them if they occur. It goes one step further and references the expected behaviour of an average individual acting in a specific situation rather than just the expectations of the law. #ref/2023/12/09/101428 #glossary
