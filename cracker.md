# Cracker
- The proper term to refer to an unauthorized attacker of computers, networks and technology instead of the misused term “[hacker](hacker.md).” However, this term is not as widely used in the media; thus, the term hacker has become more prominent in-spite of the terms misuse. (See hacker.) #ref/2023/12/09/130055 #glossary
