# Prerequisites

- A somewhat loosey-goosey list of skills you should have kinda-sorta have at your disposal before launching into learning infosec specific topics. #glossary

Can be looked at from two perspectives:
- from those already established in the field it's a list of things that are expected common knowledge when discussing infosec even at its most basic
- from those looking to get into the field it's a list of skills that will generally serve to reduce friction when learning new topics in infosec

Why is it 'loosey-goosey'? An example might help. Can you install and fire-up Wireshark and see raw packets going over the wire with little to no networking knowledge? Yes, you can. Is doing this 'infosec'? Yes, it is. So, in *some* ways you can do *some* infosec without needing networking skills. Can you look at those packets and understand whether or not someone is hacking your network? No, you can't.

You're going to need to invest significantly more time attacking the problem of 'WTF am I looking at?' if you have no networking skills than if you had already spent *some* time focused on getting the skills to recognise the various protocols and understand the interplay between the various OSI layers they operate at. It's much more efficient to focus on the basics and then build on those skills rather than focusing on the advanced stuff and thrashing around trying to piece together the underlying fundamentals.
