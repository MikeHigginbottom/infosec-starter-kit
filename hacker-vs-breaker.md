# Hacker vs Breaker
- There are many definitions of the word [hacker](hacker.md); but most of them boil down to this:  A desire to understand how things really work, so you can optimize/change the behaviour, or apply the understanding to bend the rules of the game. Hackers tend to break stuff; penetration testers tend to break stuff too. The goal should be to break stuff in order to come up with solutions on how to improve it.  If the purpose is to break stuff so you can prove you can break stuff, and systems/people have flaws…  Newsflash: we already know that.   You’re wasting your time. You’re a breaker, not a hacker. #ref/2024/01/06/210244
