# Switch
- A switch is a networking device that keeps track of MAC addresses attached to each of its ports so that data is only transmitted on the ports that are the intended recipient of the data. #ref/2023/12/09/101428 #glossary 

- Differs from a [router](router.md) in that it makes decisions based on the [MAC address](mac-address.md) rather than the [IP address](ip-address.md)
- A Layer 3 Switch can make decisions based on both [MAC address](mac-address.md) and [IP address](ip-address.md)
