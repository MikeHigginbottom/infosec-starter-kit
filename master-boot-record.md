# Master Boot Record
- Also known as the [MBR](mbr.md) or Master Partition Table (MPT), it is the first sector on a disk and contains the code used to execute the operating system as well as the location of all partitions on the drive. MBR can work with both BIOS or UEFI firmware but cannot address disks larger than 2TB. It can be replaced by the GUID Partition Table (GPT) on UEFI firmware devices. #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary
