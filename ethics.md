# Ethics
- Ethical hacking can be defined as an authorised attempt to gain unauthorised access to a network, device or data, although some consider certain unauthorised attempts to be ethical (for example, nation-state cyber attacks or attempts to expose criminals) #glossary

- Don't be a dick
- The Golden Rule: 'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you', seems like bollocks to me. I'd like my girlfriend to invite me to tour [Bletchley Park](https://bletchleypark.org.uk/) for my birthday. Pretty sure she'd rather I suggest something else for *her* birthday. Prefer The Platinum Rule: 'Do unto others as they would have you do unto them.'
