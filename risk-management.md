- The process of performing a [risk assessment](risk-assessment.md) and evaluating the responses to [risk](risk.md) in order to [mitigate](risk-mitigation.md) or otherwise handle the identified risks. Countermeasures, safeguards or security controls are to be selected that may eliminate or reduce risk, assign or transfer risk to others (i.e. outsourcing or buying insurance) or avoid and deter risk. The goal is to reduce risk down to an acceptable or [tolerable level](risk-tolerance.md). #ref/2023/12/09/130055 #glossary
