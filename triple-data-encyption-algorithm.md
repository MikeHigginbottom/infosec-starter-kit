- A [symmetric-key](symmetric-cryptography.md) [block cipher](block-cipher.md), based on, but considerably more secure than, [DES](data-encryption-standard.md), that transforms each 64-bit [plaintext](clear-text.md) block by applying the Data Encryption Algorithm three successive times, using either two or three different keys, for an effective key length of 112 or 168 bits. #ref/2023/12/09/101428 #ref/2023/12/09/095245 #glossary

- Superseded by the AES algorithm. #ref/2023/12/09/120659
- Also known as IEEE RFC1851, 3DEA, 3DES or Triple DES
