# Use After Free
- A type of memory corruption vulnerability that arises when an attempt to access previously freed memory (memory that has been de-allocated from any process) is made. This can cause the application attempting to access the memory to crash or to behave unexpectedly, or it may lead to corruption of data used the said application. #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary
