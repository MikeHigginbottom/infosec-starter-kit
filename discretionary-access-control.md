# Discretionary Access Control
- [DAC](dac.md) manages access through the use of on-object [ACLs](access-control-lists.md), which indicate which users have been granted (or denied) specific privileges or permissions on that object. #ref/2023/12/09/130055 This type of control is discretionary in the sense that subjects can manipulate it, because the owner of a resource, in addition to the security administrator, can identify who can access the resource and with what authority. #ref/2023/12/21/075445 #glossary
