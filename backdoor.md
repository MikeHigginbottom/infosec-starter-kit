- An unofficial means to access a system or application - one that's not officially supported and doesn't form part of the accepted or tested design, but which was inserted by one or more of the developers to provide a means of side-stepping the formal security mechanisms. #ref/2023/12/09/095245 Alternatively a tool installed after a compromise to give an attacker easier access to the compromised system around any security mechanisms that are in place. #ref/2023/12/09/101428 #glossary
