# Critical Infrastructure
- The physical or virtual systems and assets that are vital to an organization or country. If these systems are compromised, the result would be catastrophic. If an organization's mission critical processes are interrupted, this could result in the organization ceasing to exist. If a country's critical infrastructure is destroyed, it will have severe negative impact on national security, economic stability, citizen safety and health, transportation and communications. #ref/2023/12/09/130055 This includes the power companies, water providers, telecoms providers, government IT infrastructure, health service, rail and road infrastructure operators and the owners/operators of the major ports and airports. #ref/2023/12/09/095245 #glossary
