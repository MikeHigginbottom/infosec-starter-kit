- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) Attack|Where a piece of Malware, or even a hardware device, is inserted between the sender and receiver of a piece of data and is thus able to copy that data. #ref/2023/12/09/095245
- Man-in-the-Middle - MitM|An attack method where the attacker is able to intercept messages passing between two victims and inject new ones without the victims being aware. Encryption tools can defend against an attack. #ref/2023/12/09/120659
- Man-in-the-Middle Attack (MitM)|A man-in-the-middle attack is a type of cyber attack in which the attacker secretly intercepts and relays messages between two parties who believe they are communicating directly with each other. The attack is a type of eavesdropping in which the attacker intercepts and then controls the entire conversation. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
- MitM|See Man-in-the-Middle. #ref/2023/12/09/120659
- Pharming|This is a more sophisticated form of MITM attack. A user’s session is redirected to a masquerading website. This can be achieved by corrupting a DNS server on the Internet and pointing a URL to the masquerading website’s IP. Almost all users use a URL like www.worldbank.com instead of the real IP (192.86.99.140) of the website. Changing the pointers on a DNS server, the URL can be redirected to send traffic to the IP of the pseudo website. At the pseudo website, transactions can be mimicked and information like login credentials can be gathered. With this the attacker can access the real www.worldbank.com site and conduct transactions using the credentials of a valid user on that website. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
- Masquerade Attack|A type of attack in which one system entity illegitimately poses as (assumes the identity of) another entity. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
- Side-channel attack|Any attack that leverages information gained from a system's operation, such as power consumption, sound, computation timings or electromagnetic leaks, instead of from vulnerabilities in the system itself. #ref/2023/12/09/120659
- spoof (spoofing)|The act of falsifying the identity of the source of a communication or interaction. It is possible to spoof IP address, MAC address and email address. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
- Spoofing|An attacker or program successfully masquerades as another by falsifying data for malicious reasons. Spoofing an email address to fool a recipients or an attacker spoofing their IP or hardware (mac) address in a man-in-the-middle attack are well known attack examples. #ref/2023/12/09/120659
- Spoofing|Faking the source address of a communication in order to masquerade as a different individual or system. #ref/2023/12/09/095245
- Spoof|Attempt by an unauthorized entity to gain access to a system by posing as an authorized user. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
- Stealthing|Stealthing is a term that refers to approaches used by malicious code to conceal its presence on the infected system. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
- Watering hole attack|A watering hole attack (also referred to as a strategic web compromise) is a type of attack strategy that targets a particular group of users. An attacker compromises a website commonly used by the target group with the assumption that group members are infected as they visit the site. #ref/2023/12/09/120659
- Wiretapping|Monitoring and recording data that is flowing between two points in a communication system. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
