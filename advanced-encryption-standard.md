- A [cryptography](cryptography.md) algorithm based on a symmetric [block cipher](block-cipher.md), that is generally regarded as one of the best you can use (though see also [Elliptic Curve Algorithm](elliptic-curve-algorithm.md)). #ref/2023/12/09/095245 #glossary

- An encryption standard being developed by NIST. Intended to specify an unclassified, publicly-disclosed, symmetric encryption algorithm. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
- Also known as Rijndael #ref/2023/12/09/120659
- All AES implementations use a symmetric-key algorithm with a block size of 128 bits, but have key sizes varying between 128, 192 or 256 bits. #ref/2023/12/09/120659
