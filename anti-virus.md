# Anti Virus
- Designed to identify and remove computer viruses, other malware and spyware on a device or IT system. #ref/2023/12/09/120659  #glossary 

- Once malware is detected, the AV program will attempt to remove the offending item from the system or may simply quarantine the file for further analysis by an administrator. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
- Most anti-virus (AV) products use a pattern recognition or signature matching system to detect the presence of known malicious code. Some AV products have adopted technologies to potentially detect new and unknown malware. These technologies include anomaly detection (i.e. watch for programs which violate specific rules), behavioral detection (i.e. watch for programs that have behaviors that are different from the normal baseline of behavior of the system), and heuristic detection (i.e. watch for programs that exhibit actions which are known to be those of confirmed malware; it is a type of technological profiling). #ref/2023/12/09/130055
- To be effective it should be kept up-to-date with the latest anti-virus signatures and definitions. #ref/2023/12/09/120659
