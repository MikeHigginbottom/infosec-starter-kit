# Directory Traversal Attack
- A directory traversal attack attempts to gain unauthorised access to the file system. It involves passing characters into software that move file operations to the parent directory, with '../' being the most common sequence. This is also known as a path traversal attack, a directory climbing attack or a backtracking attack. #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary
