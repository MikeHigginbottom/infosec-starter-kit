# Shodan
- Shodan is a search engine used to find publicly accessible internet-connected devices, including servers, IoT devices, security systems and home computers. Searches can be run that target specific device groups, with more detailed results being returned if a user has an API key. Primarily a penetration testing tool, Shodan can easily be used by an attacker to find vulnerable devices for further exploitation. #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary
