# ICS
- Industrial Control System (ICS) refers to the control unit for a non-IT system, such as an air conditioning system or heavy machine plant. Industrial Control Systems are increasingly being provided with network interfaces to permit them to be managed remotely, which has made them a common target for cyber attack as they have a reputation for having poor security features. ICS is commonly used synonymously with [Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition](scada.md) systems. #ref/2023/12/09/095245 #glossary
