# Network Enumeration
- Network Enumeration discovers devices on the network and their characteristics. Not to be confused with [network mapping](network-mapping.md) but seems to be synonymous with [fingerprinting](fingerprinting.md) #ref/2023/12/08/133127 #ref/2023/12/08/135806 #glossary 

- Characteristics of interest include:
	- operating system
	- [open ports](port-scan.md)
	- details of listening network services on any open ports found
	- share names
	- directory names
	- [User Enumeration](user-enumeration.md)
	- passwords
- Techniques include:
	- Checking [banners](banner.md)
	- Sending strange packets to a system in order to gauge how it responds to determine the operating system. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
