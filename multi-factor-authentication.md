# Multi Factor Authentication
- Provides a method to verify a userâ€™s identity by requiring them to provide more than one piece of identifying information. #ref/2023/12/09/124901 #glossary

- Often uses a one-time code generated by an electronic token or smartphone program or by entering a code that is sent by the target system to the user's phone by SMS. #ref/2023/12/09/095245
- Valid factors for authentication include something you know such as passwords and PINs; something you have such as smart cards or OTP (One Time Password) devices; and something you are such as fingerprints or retina scans (aka biometrics). #ref/2023/12/09/130055
- Generally used synonymously with [Two Factor Authentication (2FA)](two-factor-authentication.md), though Multi Factor Authentication may use more than two different identification mechanisms. #ref/2023/12/09/095245
