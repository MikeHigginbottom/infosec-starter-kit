# Cryptographic Keys
- A parameter used in a cryptographic algorithm: you apply the [algorithm](cryptographic-algorithm.md) to the [clear text ](clear-text.md) and the key, and the result is the [cipher text](cipher-text.md). If a different key is used for the same clear text, the result will be a different cipher text. #ref/2023/12/09/095245 #glossary 

- Keys take the form of a numerical value. The [cryptographic strength](cryptographic-strength.md) of a key is defined by its length in binary digits. Generally, the longer the key length, the more security (i.e. defense against confidentiality breaches) it provides. The length of the key also determines the key space, which is the range of values from which the key can be selected. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
