# File-less
- This term is used to describe a process that exists exclusively in volatile system memory (such as RAM). File-less processes do not write any part of their activity to disk, making them difficult to detect with anti-virus products or computer forensic techniques. As they are designed to operate in-memory, file-less processes can be terminated by rebooting the system. #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary
