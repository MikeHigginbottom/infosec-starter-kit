- Hashing is the cryptographic operation that produces a representational value from an input data set. A before and after hash can be compared in order to detect protection of or violation of [integrity](integrity.md). #ref/2023/12/09/130055 #glossary 
- File hash|File hashes are a unique value produced by running a hash algorithm against a file. Anti-malware researchers publish malware hash value details as indicators of compromise. If a file hash value for a file on a victim’s system matches one of the published hashes then the malware is present and can be identified. There is a very small possibility that two files could have the same hash value, this is called ‘hash collision’. #ref/2023/12/09/120659
- Hash Functions|(cryptographic) hash functions are used to generate a one way "check sum" for a larger text, which is not trivially reversed. The result of this hash function can be used to validate if a larger file has been altered, without having to compare the larger files to each other. Frequently used hash functions are MD5 and SHA1. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
- Hash Function|A function that takes a Clear Text string and converts it into a cryptic, fixed-length string. The point of a Hash Function is that it's one-way; that is, it is effectively impossible to take the hashed version and transform it back into the Clear Text version. #ref/2023/12/09/095245
- Hash Function|An algorithm that computes a value based on a data object thereby mapping the data object to a smaller data object. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
- Hash|The product of passing an arbitrary amount of data through a cryptographic hashing function. Hashes typically have a fixed length and are unique to the original data. Common hashing functions include: #ref/2023/12/09/120659
- md5|A one way cryptographic hash function. Also see "hash functions" and "sha1" #ref/2023/12/09/101428
- Message Digest 5 (MD5)|A well-known Hash Function which is considered insecure owing to its susceptibility to Collisions. #ref/2023/12/09/095245
- Message Digest|The output after applying a Hash Function to some Plain Text. #ref/2023/12/09/095245
- One-Way Encryption|Irreversible transformation of plaintext to cipher text, such that the plaintext cannot be recovered from the cipher text by other than exhaustive procedures even if the cryptographic key is known. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
- One-Way Function|A (mathematical) function, f, which is easy to compute the output based on a given input. However given only the output value it is impossible (except for a brute force attack) to figure out what the input value is. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
- One-Way Hash Function|Synonymous with Hash Function. All Hash Functions are one-way by definition. #ref/2023/12/09/095245
- Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)|The most commonly used family of Hash Functions; unlike Message Digest 5 there are no known vulnerabilities in the more recently devised SHA algorithms. #ref/2023/12/09/095245
