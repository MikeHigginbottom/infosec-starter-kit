- A pop-under is a form of creating a new browser window. This is designed to be undetectable user and typically will not interrupt the users browsing session. It is common for pop-unders to display no information. Pop-unders are used to run scripts, usually unbeknown to the users. These scripts are not necessarily malicious, but there is very little justification for a web application to do this. #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary
