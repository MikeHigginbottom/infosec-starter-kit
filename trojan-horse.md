- A form of malware where a malicious payload is embedded inside of a benign host file. The victim is tricked into believing that the only file being retrieved is the viewable benign host. However, when the victim uses the host file, the malicious payload is automatically deposited onto their computer system. #ref/2023/12/09/130055 #glossary
