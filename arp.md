- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a protocol for mapping an [Internet Protocol address](ip-address.md) to a [physical machine address](mac-address.md) that is recognized in the local network. #ref/2023/12/09/101428 #glossary

- A table, usually called the ARP cache, is used to maintain a correlation between each MAC address and its corresponding IP address. ARP provides the protocol rules for making this correlation and providing address conversion in both directions. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
