# Run-PE
- RunPE (short for Run Portable Executable) is a popular technique for disguising malicious programs behind legitimate applications. When a malicious program starts it will begin a new instance of a Windows process but in a suspended state; it will then overwrite that process's memory with its own code. The process is then resumed, but it now runs the malicious code instead. #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary
