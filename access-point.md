# Access Point
- The "landing point" of a [Wireless Local Area Network](wlan.md): the AP is the entity to which each device on the wireless network connects directly. #ref/2023/12/09/095245 #glossary 

- Some APs are autonomous and do all the work of interacting with the [client](client.md) devices (often called "fat APs") while others ("thin APs") are little more than radios that channel the traffic back to a central control point. Thin APs are better from a security point of view because everything's controlled centrally, which makes management easier and hence less error-prone. #ref/2023/12/09/095245
