# Zeroization
- Overwriting data on disk or tape multiple times in order to render it unreadable, on the premise that deleting a file in most operating systems usually just removes the directly entry but leaves the file content on the disk. On magnetic disks the accuracy tolerance of the read/write head on the disk is such that an attempt to overwrite an item once may be slightly askew of the precise point at which the data is located, and so Zeroization of magnetic disks involves writing each element several times to achieve a high probability of overwriting the exact location. #ref/2023/12/09/095245 #glossary
