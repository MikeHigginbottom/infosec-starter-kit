- Boot Record Infector|A boot record infector is a piece of malware that inserts malicious code into the boot sector of a disk. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
- Bootkit|A bootkit acts much the same as a rootkit, however it targets the master boot record which allows it to be executed prior to the loading of the operating system (OS). This allows for bootkits to remain undetected on a system, as the components remain outside of the OS file system, making them undetectable by traditional anti-virus software. #ref/2023/12/09/120659
