It is common for pop-unders to display no information. Pop-unders are used to run scripts, usually unbeknown to the users. These scripts are not necessarily malicious, but there is very little justification for a web application to do this. #ref/2023/12/09/120659

- worm|A form of malware that focuses on replication and distribution. A worm is a self-contained malicious program that attempts to duplicate itself and spread to other systems. Generally, the damage caused by a worm is indirect and due to the worm's replication and distribution activities consuming all system resources. A worm can be used to deposit other forms of malware on each system it encounters. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
- Worm|A Malware computer program that spreads to other machines by replicating itself and sending copies of itself using vulnerabilities in those other machines. The most famous worm was created in 1988 by Robert Tappan Morris. #ref/2023/12/09/095245
- Worm|A type of malware that is standalone and spreads to other machines by replicating itself. The replication rapidly consumes storage and creates performance issues.

- Spam|Spam is slang commonly used to describe junk e-mail on the Internet. #ref/2023/12/09/124901
- Spam|Unsolicited bulk messages, generally sent by email. Spam is a popular way to target people because although only a fraction of the messages penetrate the organisation's defence, the sheer quantity of messages makes this fraction numerically significant. #ref/2023/12/09/095245
- Spam|Unwanted and unsolicited bulk email. The email messages may be commercial by nature but can also contain disguised links that appear to be for familiar websites but lead to phishing websites or sites that are hosting malware. Spam email may also include malware as scripts or other executable file attachments. #ref/2023/12/09/120659
- spyware|A form of malware that monitors user activities and reports them to an external their party. Spyware can be legitimate in that it is operated by an advertising and marketing agency for the purpose of gathering customer demographics. However, spyware can also be operated by attackers using the data gathering tool to steal an identity or learn enough about a victim to harm them in other ways. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
- Spyware|Malware that passes information about a computer user’s activities to an external party. #ref/2023/12/09/125539

- Trojan Horse (Trojan)|A form of malware where a malicious payload is imbedded inside of a benign host file. The victim is tricked into believing that the only file being retrieved is the viewable benign host. However, when the victim uses the host file, the malicious payload is automatically deposited onto their computer system. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
- Trojan Horse|A computer program that appears to have a useful function, but also has a hidden and potentially malicious function that evades security mechanisms, sometimes by exploiting legitimate authorizations of a system entity that invokes the program. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
- Trojan Horse|A malicious program hidden inside an ostensibly innocuous one. #ref/2023/12/09/095245

- Trojan|Named after the trojan horse from Greek mythology, a trojan is a type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software, which tricks a user into installing it. Trojans usually have a payload of other malware and some open a backdoor that allows an attacker access to the victim's machine. #ref/2023/12/09/120659
- Virus|A common alternative term for Malware. #ref/2023/12/09/095245

- virus|A form of malware that often attaches itself to a host file or the MBR (Master Boot Record) as a parasite. When the host file or MBR is accessed, it activates the virus enabling it to infect other objects. Most viruses spread through human activity within and between computers. A virus is typically designed to damage or destroy data, but different viruses implement their attack at different rates, speeds or targets. For example, some viruses attempt to destroy files on a computer as quickly as possible while others may do so slowly over hours or days. Others might only target images or Word documents (.doc/.docx). #ref/2023/12/09/130055
- Virus|A hidden, self-replicating section of computer software, usually malicious logic, that propagates by infecting - i.e., inserting a copy of itself into and becoming part of - another program. A virus cannot run by itself; it requires that its host program be run to make the virus active. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
- Virus|A malware that can make changes, corrupt or delete data on a computer. A virus needs user interaction to trigger it. #ref/2023/12/09/120659
