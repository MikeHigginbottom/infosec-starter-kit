# DNSSec
- The Domain Name System (DNS) did not include any security features as the priority was for the design to be a scalable distributed system. The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) attempts to address the security weaknesses while maintaining backward compatibility. Essentially, DNSSEC adds authentication to DNS to make the system more secure.  #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary
