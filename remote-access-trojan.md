# Remote Access Trojan
- Software that allows a remote user to control a system. It can also be referred to as a remote administration tool. Legitimate implementations are common but RAT software can also be used for malicious activity. The malicious RAT software is typically installed by a trojan without the victim's knowledge and will try to hide its operation from the victim and from security software. #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary
