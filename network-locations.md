- Demilitarised Zone (DMZ)|A network that sits between the Internet and the secure LAN, in which you put services such as Web and email servers. #ref/2023/12/09/095245
- Demilitarised zone - DMZ|A demilitarised zone (DMZ) is a physical or logical network used to separate an internal network from other, untrusted networks. Services and resources such as mail and FTP servers are contained within the DMZ in order to be accessible from external networks, such as the internet, but the rest of the internal network is unreachable.  #ref/2023/12/09/120659
- Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)|In computer security, in general a demilitarized zone (DMZ) or perimeter network is a network area (a subnetwork) that sits between an organization's internal network and an external network, usually the Internet. DMZ's help to enable the layered security model in that they provide subnetwork segmentation based on security requirements or policy. DMZ's provide either a transit mechanism from a secure source to an insecure destination or from an insecure source to a more secure destination. In some cases, a screened subnet which is used for servers accessible from the outside is referred to as a DMZ. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
- DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)|A segment or subnet of a private network where resources are hosted and accessed by the general public from the Internet. The DMZ is isolated from the private network using a firewall and is protected from obvious abuses and attacks from the Internet using a firewall. A DMZ can be deployed in two main configurations. One method is the screened subnet configuration, which has the structure of I-F-DMZ-F-LAN (i.e. internet, then firewall, then the DMZ, then another firewall, then the private LAN). A second method is the multi-homed firewall configuration, which has the structure of a single firewall with three interfaces, one connecting to the Internet, a second to the DMZ, and a third to the private LAN. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
- DMZ|See Demilitarised Zone. #ref/2023/12/09/120659
- DMZ|Segment of a network where servers accessed by less trusted users are isolated. The name is derived from the term “demilitarised zone”. #ref/2023/12/09/125539
- ISP (Internet Service Provider)|The organization that provides connectivity to the Internet for individuals or companies. Some ISPs offer additional services above that of just connectivity such as e-mail, web hosting and domain registration. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
- Security perimeter|A well-defined boundary within which security controls are enforced. #ref/2023/12/09/125539
- security perimeter|The boundary of a network or private environment where specific security policies and rules are enforced. The systems and users within the security boundary are forced into compliance with local security rules while anything outside is not under such restrictions. The security perimeter prevents any interactions between outside entities and internal entities that might violate or threaten the security of the internal systems. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
- Sinkhole|A DNS sinkhole, also known as a sinkhole server, internet sinkhole, or blackhole DNS is a DNS server that gives out false information to prevent the use of a domain name. #ref/2023/12/09/120659
