# DNS Server
- A Domain Name Service (DNS) Server translates a domain name (which is easy for humans to remember such as `google.com`) into its corresponding [IP address](ip-address.md) used by computers to route the traffic to the correct destination. Both public (open) and private DNS servers can be implemented. #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary
