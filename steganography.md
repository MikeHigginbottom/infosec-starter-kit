# Steganography
- Methods of hiding the existence of a message or other data within another file, message, image, or video. This is different than [cryptography](cryptography.md), which hides the meaning of a message but does not hide the message itself. An example of a steganographic method is "invisible" ink. #ref/2023/12/09/101428 #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary
