# Do You Need A Degree?

I’m often asked if getting a (Associates, Bachelors, or Masters) degree is necessary to get a foot in the door in InfoSec. In the US, the answer is usually no. As I discussed previously, InfoSec interviewers _usually_ value motivation, critical thinking, and self-study above all else while selecting entry level candidates. #ref/2024/01/15/105136

Government agencies and large corporations still tend to value degrees highly and may even refuse to waive them as a requirement for their hiring authorities. And within these types of organizations, pay grade or promotion may be contingent on having a degree. #ref/2024/01/15/105136

I usually view degrees favorably when they’re financially feasible. They show dedication to a task for two or more years, and an interest in some subject. I also trust credible universities to teach students general business skills like reading, presenting, and report writing (all of which are underappreciated but valuable in security). Thus far I haven’t seen much value in specifically gaining an InfoSec degree. #ref/2024/01/15/105136
