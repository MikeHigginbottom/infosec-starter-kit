# Certifications
- [Cyber Security Qualifications Framework (CSQF)](cyber-security-qualifications-framework.md)
- [CyBOK](cybok.md)
- [Do You Need A Degree?](do-you-need-a-degree.md)
- I’d consider certifications a ‘nice to have’ for an entry level candidate – they are not likely to tip the balance much in a hiring decision. #ref/2024/01/15/105136
- I’ve recommended SANS / GIAC line of certifications in the past because I find their training and tests some of the most legitimate. Their certifications are some of the most technically respected to have on a technical resume. However, their certifications are also extremely expensive. #ref/2024/01/15/105136
- Offensive-Security offers the OSCP certification and course which is a fantastic choice for InfoSec applicants who wish to take a more offense-based route (or indeed, as exposure to those techniques to anybody in InfoSec). It’s real-world lab heavy. #ref/2024/01/15/105136
- I personally do not recommend EC-Council certifications for entry level candidates at this time unless they are specifically required for a role. #ref/2024/01/15/105136
