# Checksum
- A calculation that's used to confirm the Integrity of a collection of data: a calculation is performed on all the individual bytes of data and the result is the checksum. Checksums are good for checking for corruption but less so for ensuring that the data has not been tampered with, because it's often possible to change the data so that the checksum works out correctly; use a Hash Function instead in the latter case. #ref/2023/12/09/095245 #glossary
