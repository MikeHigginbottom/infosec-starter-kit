# Anonymous FTP
- Anonymous FTP allows a user to retrieve documents, files, programs, and other archived data from anywhere in the Internet without having to establish a userid and password. By using the special userid of `anonymous` the network user will bypass local security checks and will have access to publicly accessible files on the remote system.
