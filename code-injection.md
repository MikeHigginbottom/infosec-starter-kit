- An attack that introduces malicious code into a software application and then executes the code when the application is opened. Examples include SQL injection, which can compromise or modify information in a database, and cross-site scripting (XSS) which can allow hackers to hijack user accounts or display fraudulent content. #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary
