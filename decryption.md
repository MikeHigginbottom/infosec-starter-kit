- Conversion of [cipher text](cipher-text.md) to [clear text](clear-text.md). The reverse of [encryption](encryption.md) #glossary

- Decryption Algorithm|The opposite of an Encryption Algorithm. #ref/2023/12/09/095245
- Decryption|Decryption is the process of transforming an encrypted message into its original plaintext. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
- Decryption|The process of transforming encrypted data back into a state in which it is usable by the system. #ref/2023/12/09/120659
- Decryptor|A tool, also known as a decrypter, used to decrypt previously encrypted data, typically that which has been encrypted by a ransomware tool. Several well-known security and anti-malware vendors produce their own free decrypters, which can be found on the No More Ransom website. #ref/2023/12/09/120659
- decrypt|The act which transforms ciphertext (i.e. the unintelligible and seeming random form of data that is produced by the cryptographic function of encryption) back into its original plaintext or cleartext form. Ciphertext is produced by a symmetric encryption algorithm when a data set is transformed by the encryption process using a selected key. Ciphertext can converted back into its original form (i.e. plaintext) by performing the decryption process using the same symmetric encryption algorithm and the same key used during the encryption process. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
- Decrypt|To convert Cipher Text into Clear Text using a Decryption Algorithm. #ref/2023/12/09/095245
