# Chief Information Officer
- The head of information services within an organisation; the individual responsible for information processing and IT systems from a business-oriented point of view. Sometimes the CIO is also responsible for the underlying infrastructure in a raw technical sense, but often the latter is the remit of the Chief Technology Officer. #ref/2023/12/09/095245 #glossary
