# Domain Generation Algorithm
- Domain generation algorithms (DGA) are algorithms that periodically generate large numbers of unique domain names for use as rendezvous points for command and control (C2) servers. This makes it extremely difficult to prevent malware from communicating with their C2 network. #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary
