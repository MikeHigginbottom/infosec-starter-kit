# Audit
- An assessment of an organisation's operations, such as security monitoring, policies and standards, system security, threat and vulnerability management against one or more specified standards. Internal audits, often called first-party audits, are conducted as self-assessments by the organisation itself; external, or third-party audits, are conducted by an independent assessor from outside the organisation. #ref/2023/12/09/095245 #glossary

- Knowledge of regulatory standards is necessary (PCI-DSS, Sarbanes Oxley, etc).
