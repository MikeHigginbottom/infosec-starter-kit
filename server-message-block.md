# Server Message Block
- Server Message Block ([SMB](smb.md), also known as Common Internet File System, CIFS) is an application-layer networking protocol used for sharing access to files, devices or other miscellaneous communications between nodes on a network over TCP ports 139 and 445. It is primarily used by the Windows operating system, with several open-source implementations such as Samba available for other operating systems. #ref/2023/12/09/120659  #glossary
