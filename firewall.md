# Firewall
- A software program or piece of hardware that filters traffic between two networks (commonly between a private LAN and the Internet) in order to ensure that only the desired connections can happen. #ref/2023/12/09/095245 #ref/2023/12/09/124901 #glossary

- Rules, filters or ACLs can be defined to indicate which traffic is allowed to cross the firewall. Advanced firewalls can make allow/deny decisions based on user authentication, protocol, header values and even payload contents. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
