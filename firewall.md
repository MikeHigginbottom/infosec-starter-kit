# Firewall
- A software program or piece of hardware that filters traffic between two networks (commonly between a private LAN and the Internet) in order to ensure that only the desired connections can happen. #ref/2023/12/09/095245 #ref/2023/12/09/124901 #glossary

- Rules, filters or ACLs can be defined to indicate which traffic is allowed to cross the firewall. Advanced firewalls can make allow/deny decisions based on user authentication, protocol, header values and even payload contents. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
- Firewalls can usually act as a Layer 3 [router](router.md)
- Older firewalls have Layer 4 functionality which implies they can filter by port number.
- Newer firewalls can look at application layer traffic and can also implement encrypted tunnels.
- A firewall can act as a [proxy](proxy-server.md)
- [Packet Filter](packet-filter.md)
- [Personal Firewall](personal-firewall.md)
