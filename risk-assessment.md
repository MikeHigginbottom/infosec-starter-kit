# Risk Assessment
- The process of identifying, analysing, evaluating and documenting risk #ref/2023/12/09/125539 and the potential impact of those risks. #ref/2023/12/09/101428 #glossary

- Risk assessment is often initiated through taking an inventory of all [assets](asset.md), assigning each asset a value, and then considering any potential threats against each asset. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
- Threats are evaluated for their exposure factor (EF) (i.e. the amount of loss that would be caused by the threat causing harm) and frequency of occurrence (i.e. ARO—Annualized Rate of Occurrence) in order to calculate a relative risk value known as the ALE (Annualized Loss Expectancy). The largest ALE indicates the biggest concern or risk for the organization. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
