# Tunneling
- Sending data using one protocol through a connection established using another. #ref/2023/12/09/095245  #glossary

- Most often, a tunnel is a logical point-to-point link - i.e., an OSI layer 2 connection - created by encapsulating the layer 2 protocol in a transport protocol (such as TCP), in a network or inter-network layer protocol (such as IP), or in another link layer protocol. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
- Tunneling can move data between computers that use a protocol not supported by the network connecting them. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
- Virtual Private Networks are a good example of tunnels. #ref/2023/12/09/095245
