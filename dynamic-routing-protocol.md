# Dynamic Routing Protocol
- Dynamic routing occurs when routers talk to adjacent routers, informing each other of what networks each router is currently connected to in order to determine the possible routes between themselves. The routers must communicate using a routing protocol, of which there are many to choose from. The process on the router that is running the routing protocol, communicating with its neighbour routers, is usually called a routing daemon. The routing daemon updates the kernel's routing table with information it receives from neighbour routers. #ref/2023/12/09/101428 #glossary
