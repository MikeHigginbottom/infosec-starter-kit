# Potentially Unwanted Program
- A potentially unwanted program, also known as a potentially unwanted application (PUA), is usually downloaded alongside legitimate software without the user being aware and is mainly spyware or adware. The user has inadvertently agreed to install the PUP by agreeing to the terms when downloading the legitimate software which differentiates it from malware. Most anti-malware tools will alert the user if PUP is discovered. #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary
