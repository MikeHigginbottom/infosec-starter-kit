# Lab Book
- Either a physical or a digital store of information relevant to your activities in the infosec domain. Research notes, checklists, processes, references, logs will likely be included.  #glossary 

You’re going to need to make notes. Lots of notes.

- They need to be well organised, support your required use cases efficiently and be consistent to an appropriate degree.
- They need to hang together as a holistic framework of information that you can slot new information into.
- They need to be trivial and efficient to search.
- They need to be free from repetition and the goal should be for them to be complete.

Go digital. No paper, no question. The only non-digital stuff you _might_ need to add is sketches. Either scan them or draw them in some kind of digital drawing software. The advantages of digital notes are so vast as to make the choice an absolute no-brainer.

Plain text is king but some mark-up imposed on top provides valuable functionality with minimal complication. Do _not_ fuck about with colours or bold or fonts unless you *genuinely* gain a *lot* from their use. Markdown is my preferred mark-up. And Obsidian is my preferred app (YMMV).

Atomic notes. Loosely linked together. Again, no question. Impose your own structure on your notes. It’s easier to lump than to split, so keep your notes small and specific and separated. Don’t let them restrict you by being smushed together.

Keep a log of the exact steps you take when spinning up a new machine. Or scanning for vulnerabilities. There is enough noise in any experiment that even doing this means you may not be able to repeat the same result twice. Don’t make it harder for yourself. Document _everything_. Well... try to.
