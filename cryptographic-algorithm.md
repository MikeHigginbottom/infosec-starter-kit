- Data Encryption Standard (DES)|A symmetric encryption algorithm (known commonly as "DES") devised in the 1970s; superseded by Triple DES. #ref/2023/12/09/095245
- Data Encryption Standard (DES)|A widely-used method of data encryption using a private (secret) key. There are 72,000,000,000,000,000 (72 quadrillion) or more possible encryption keys that can be used. For each given message, the key is chosen at random from among this enormous number of keys. Like other private key cryptographic methods, both the sender and the receiver must know and use the same private key. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
- Data Encryption Standard - DES|A symmetric-key encryption algorithm created in 1975. DES has several well-publicised vulnerabilities and has been has been withdrawn for use by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The AES algorithm has superseded DES in most cases. #ref/2023/12/09/120659

- Triple Data Encryption Algorithm - 3DEA|Triple Data Encryption Algorithm IEEE RFC1851 (3DEA, 3DES or Triple DES) is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm. It has been superseded by the AES algorithm. #ref/2023/12/09/120659
- Triple DES (3DES)|A development of the Data Encryption Standard which is considerably more secure. #ref/2023/12/09/095245
- Triple DES|A block cipher, based on DES, that transforms each 64-bit plaintext block by applying the Data Encryption Algorithm three successive times, using either two or three different keys, for an effective key length of 112 or 168 bits. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
