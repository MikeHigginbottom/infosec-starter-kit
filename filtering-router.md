# Filtering Router
- An inter-network router that selectively prevents the passage of data packets according to a security policy. A filtering router may be used as a [firewall](firewall.md) or part of a firewall. A router usually receives a packet from a network and decides where to forward it on a second network. A filtering router does the same, but first decides whether the packet should be forwarded at all, according to some security policy. The policy is implemented by rules (packet filters) loaded into the router. #ref/2023/12/09/101428 #glossary
