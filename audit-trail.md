# Audit Trail
- The next level up from an [Audit Log](audit-log.md), an audit trail is a chronology of events but is generally more human-readable than an Audit Log. The latter is system-generated and hence can be cryptic; the audit trail is built by a human being using sources such as the audit log and is written to be readable by non-technical people. #ref/2023/12/09/095245 #glossary
