- Data Encryption Standard (DES)|A symmetric encryption algorithm (known commonly as "DES") devised in the 1970s; superseded by Triple DES. #ref/2023/12/09/095245
- Data Encryption Standard (DES)|A widely-used method of data encryption using a private (secret) key. There are 72,000,000,000,000,000 (72 quadrillion) or more possible encryption keys that can be used. For each given message, the key is chosen at random from among this enormous number of keys. Like other private key cryptographic methods, both the sender and the receiver must know and use the same private key. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
- Data Encryption Standard - DES|A symmetric-key encryption algorithm created in 1975. DES has several well-publicised vulnerabilities and has been has been withdrawn for use by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The AES algorithm has superseded DES in most cases. #ref/2023/12/09/120659
