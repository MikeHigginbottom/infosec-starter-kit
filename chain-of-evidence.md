# Chain Of Evidence
- A definitive, provable sequence of events and/or actions that you use to demonstrate to a court or tribunal, or your HR department, that conclusively demonstrates what occurred in a security breach. It should be possible to step through your Chain of Evidence from beginning to end and demonstrate that none of the evidence could have been tampered with or illicitly seen at any stage. #ref/2023/12/09/095245 #glossary
