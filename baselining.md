# Baselining
- Monitoring your systems' behaviour to establish what looks normal, so that your security systems can alert you if they detect abnormal behaviour. #ref/2023/12/09/095245 #glossary 

- Recording the events and activities of a system and its users. The recorded events are compared against security policy and behavioural baselines to evaluate compliance and/or discover violations. Behavioural monitoring can include the tracking of trends, setting of thresholds and defining responses. Trend tracking can reveal when errors are increasing requiring technical support services, when abnormal load levels occur indicating the presence of malicious code, or when production work levels increase indicating a need to expand capacity. Thresholds are used to define the levels of activity or events above which are of concern and require a response. The levels below the threshold are recorded but do not trigger a response. Responses can be to resolve conflicts, handle violations, prevent downtime or improve capabilities. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
