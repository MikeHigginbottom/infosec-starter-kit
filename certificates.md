# Certificates
- A digital certificate is a file or electronic password that proves the authenticity of a device, server, or user through the use of cryptography and [public key infrastructure](public-key-infrastructure.md) #ref/2023/12/18/142843 #glossary

- It contains your name, a serial number, expiration dates, a copy of the certificate holder's public key (used for encrypting messages and digital signatures), and the digital signature of the certificate-issuing authority so that a recipient can verify that the certificate is real. #ref/2023/12/09/101428
