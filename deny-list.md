# Deny List
- A list of specifically un-trusted actions, resources or destinations that a user, system or application cannot access #ref/2023/12/09/095245 #glossary

- Known in some places as a [block list](block-list.md) or a [blacklist](black-list.md) although this latter term is falling out of favour.
- The opposite of a [allow list](allow-list.md).
- Less secure than allow listing because its default action is to allow operation
- Typically less resource intensive and requires less maintenance than an [allow list](allow-list.md)
