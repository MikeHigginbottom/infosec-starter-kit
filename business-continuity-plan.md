# Business Continuity Plan
- A framework and procedure set that you build in order to maximise your chances of recovering from a business-impacting incident (which could include a security breach or some such). #ref/2023/12/09/095245 Includes response, [backup operations](backup.md), and post-disaster [recovery](recovery.md) steps that will ensure the [availability](availability.md) of critical resources and facilitate the continuity of operations in an emergency situation. #ref/2023/12/09/101428 #glossary

- The goal of BCP is to prevent the failure of mission critical processes when they have be harmed by a breach or accident. Once core business tasks have been stabilized, BCP dictates the procedure to return the environment back to normal conditions. BCP is used when the normal security policy has failed to prevent harm from occurring, but before the harm has reached the level of fully interrupting mission critical processes, which would trigger the [Disaster Recovery Process (DRP)](disaster-recovery-plan.md) #ref/2023/12/09/130055
