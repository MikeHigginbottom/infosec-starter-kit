# Ransomware
- A form of malware that holds a victim's data hostage on their computer typically through robust encryption. This is followed by a demand for payment in the form of Bitcoin (an untraceable digital currency) in order to release control of the captured data back to the user. #ref/2023/12/09/130055 #glossary

- Different variants of ransomware can encrypt files, full disks or system configurations to prevent access and hold the user to ransom until a decryption key is paid for.  #ref/2023/12/09/120659
- Anti-malware suppliers work to publish decryption tools.  #ref/2023/12/09/120659 
- It is not recommended to pay any ransom demands and organisations should implement [backup](backup.md) and [recovery](recovery.md) strategies to enable recovery from ransomware.    #ref/2023/12/09/120659
