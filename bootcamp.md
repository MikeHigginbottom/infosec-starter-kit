# Bootcamp
- A highly intensive approach to training in which students are exposed to a high level of material in just a few days (typically around a week) but with a high number of hours per day in the classroom. #ref/2023/12/09/095245 #glossary 

- Can be a great way to gain a foundation in a subject but be very wary of promises of finding a job after a week's basic training.
