# Attitude
- Refers to your overall approach to the subject of infosec including your level of curiosity, your motivations, your [ethics](ethics.md) and your goals #glossary 

- To hack something (or defend it from hacking), you must have a solid understanding of how that thing works. #ref/2024/01/15/105136

- InfoSec is not a career that can be put in a box once you go home from work or school. You must be passionate enough about the field to be continually learning and aware of quickly changing current events. #ref/2024/01/15/105136
- There’s a misconception that sophisticated attackers use lots of malware and exploits. This is simply not the case. The better a hacker is, the more likely he or she is to leverage pre-existing software and tools to compromise a network whenever possible. With malware comes more risk of detection and forensics. #ref/2024/01/15/105136

- Professionalism is the packaging that you use to present yourself. Failing at this means your content can be world-class and you can still go unnoticed or be passed over. Here are the basics: #ref/2021/02/22/075045
	1. _Dependability_. Don’t make commitments you don’t keep. Don’t miss meetings. Be early, not late. Don’t miss deadlines for projects. Under-promise and over-deliver.
	2. _Wardrobe_. Build yourself a decent wardrobe. Drop the t-shirts. Drop the gym shoes. Get yourself some quality jeans (dark) and some quality shoes. Invest in some decent dress shirts. Make sure everything fits well. And buy a couple of jackets to wear with your jeans; they are an exponent, not a multiplier. Finally, have at least one good suit for when it’s needed.
	3. _Speak concisely_. Be clear and crisp with your verbal communication. Don’t linger on points. Get them out cleanly and stop so the other person can reply.
	4. _Tighten up your writing_.
	5. _Learn to present_. Public speaking is a beast for many people, but if you can’t present you’ll be severely limited in how far you can advance. I recommend Toastmasters for anyone who has significant issues with the prospect of getting in front of people.
