# Attitude
- Refers to your overall approach to the subject of infosec including your level of curiosity, your motivations, your [ethics](ethics.md) and your goals #glossary 

- To hack something (or defend it from hacking), you must have a solid understanding of how that thing works. #ref/2024/01/15/105136
- You also have to develop a kind of faith in your own learning capacity — a belief that even though you may not know all of what you need to solve a problem, if you tackle just a piece of it and learn from that, you'll learn enough to solve the next piece — and so on, until you're done. #ref/2024/01/17/125834

- InfoSec is not a career that can be put in a box once you go home from work or school. You must be passionate enough about the field to be continually learning and aware of quickly changing current events. #ref/2024/01/15/105136
- Hackers don't get to be the way they are by imitating each other. Rather, it seems to be the case that the combination of personality traits that makes a hacker so conditions one's outlook on life that one tends to end up being like other hackers whether one wants to or not. #ref/2024/02/07/185353
- The ties many hackers have to AI research and SF literature may have helped them to develop an idea of personhood that is inclusive rather than exclusive — after all, if one's imagination readily grants full human rights to future AI programs, robots, dolphins, and extraterrestrial aliens, mere color and gender can't seem very important any more. #ref/2024/02/07/190029
- There’s a misconception that sophisticated attackers use lots of malware and exploits. This is simply not the case. The better a hacker is, the more likely he or she is to leverage pre-existing software and tools to compromise a network whenever possible. With malware comes more risk of detection and forensics. #ref/2024/01/15/105136
- Professionalism is the packaging that you use to present yourself. Failing at this means your content can be world-class and you can still go unnoticed or be passed over. Here are the basics: #ref/2021/02/22/075045
	1. _Dependability_. Don’t make commitments you don’t keep. Don’t miss meetings. Be early, not late. Don’t miss deadlines for projects. Under-promise and over-deliver.
	2. _Wardrobe_. Build yourself a decent wardrobe. Drop the t-shirts. Drop the gym shoes. Get yourself some quality jeans (dark) and some quality shoes. Invest in some decent dress shirts. Make sure everything fits well. And buy a couple of jackets to wear with your jeans; they are an exponent, not a multiplier. Finally, have at least one good suit for when it’s needed.
	3. _Speak concisely_. Be clear and crisp with your verbal communication. Don’t linger on points. Get them out cleanly and stop so the other person can reply.
	4. _Tighten up your writing_.
	5. _Learn to present_. Public speaking is a beast for many people, but if you can’t present you’ll be severely limited in how far you can advance. I recommend Toastmasters for anyone who has significant issues with the prospect of getting in front of people.
- Hacking does not only apply to computers and networks and code but also things like “life-hacks” or hacking government policy. #ref/2024/01/17/114940
- The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved. Hackers have a bias for action and a bias towards learning. There is no expectation that a hacker knows the answer when they look at a problem for the first time, but rather that they will methodically work through it using the knowledge and skills they have. #ref/2024/01/17/114940 
- No problem should ever have to be solved twice. By solving a problem shared by society you free others from worrying about that problem. This can be applied to an attitude towards open source, to information sharing more generally and to automation. #ref/2024/01/17/114940
- Boredom and drudgery are evil. Automate all the things. #ref/2024/01/17/114940
- Freedom is good. Authoritarians do not allow the freedom to solve problems by creating rules and situations that cannot be worked around legally. #ref/2024/01/17/114940
- Attitude is no substitute for competence. But recognise that not everyone is competent yet. #ref/2024/01/17/114940
