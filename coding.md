# Coding
- A basic understanding of coding constructs and writing simple scripts in one or maybe a couple of languages. #glossary

To progress beyond just using tools to actually producing things and starting to forge your own research path you're going to need to have at least some basic coding skills. Maybe start with Python. It's not necessarily the most appropriate language for all tasks but it is a really good all-rounder and a pretty gentle intro if you've not done very much (or any) coding before. You might then want to look into bash scripting or PowerShell or maybe even C for some low level stuff. But that's really going beyond 'prerequisites'.
