# Simple Network Management Protocol
- [SNMP](snmp.md) allows devices connected to a network to share information about their current state for network monitoring purposes and also provides a channel through which an administrator can modify pre-defined values. To provide a degree of security, SNMP Community strings that work in a similar way to a password are transmitted to a device with any command string to authenticate its execution.  #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary
