# Address Space Layout Randomisation
- Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR) is a computer security technique involved in protection from buffer overflow attacks. In order to prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to a particular exploited function in memory, ASLR randomly arranges the address space positions of key data areas of a process. #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary
