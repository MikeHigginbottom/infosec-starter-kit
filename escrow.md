# Escrow
- Where two parties lodge, with a third party, something that's important to both of them but which the recipient can't be certain to be able to get from the provider. Code escrow is a common concept: if company B builds a bespoke piece of software for company A, it's common for both parties to agree to lodge a copy of the source code "in Escrow" with party C, who is trusted to release that source code to company A only in the event that company B goes out of business. #ref/2023/12/09/095245 #glossary
