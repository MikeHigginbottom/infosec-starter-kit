# Hot Site
- Contains fully redundant hardware and software, with telecommunications, telephone and utility connectivity to continue all primary site operations. Failover occurs within minutes or hours, following a disaster. Daily data synchronization usually occurs between the primary and hot site, resulting in minimum or no data loss. Offsite data [backup](backup.md) tapes might be obtained and delivered to the hot site to help [restore](restore.md) operations. Backup tapes should be regularly tested to detect data corruption, malicious code and environmental damage. A hot site is the most expensive option. #ref/2023/12/09/101428  #glossary
