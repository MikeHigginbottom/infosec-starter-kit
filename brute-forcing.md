# Brute Forcing
- A brute-force attack consists of an attacker systematically checking all possible passwords/passphrases in the hope of eventually guessing correctly. #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary

- Brute Force attacks work best not by trying to log into a remote system multiple times (each connection can take several seconds - which adds up when trying several million passwords) but by breaking in and stealing the password file and running the cracker against it. #ref/2023/12/09/095245
