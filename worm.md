# Worm
- A type of malware that is standalone and spreads to other machines by replicating itself. The replication rapidly consumes storage and creates performance issues. In contrast to a [virus](virus.md), worms are triggered without user interaction and are capable of targeted attacks. Worms can be used to distribute and drop other malware such as ransomware. #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary
