- Brute Force Attack|A means of trying to figure out the password of a particular login account for a system. It's the simplest cracking program to write because you just have to loop through every possible password or through every entry in an extensive list of potential passwords. Trouble is, trying every possible combination takes a long time. Brute Force attacks work best not by trying to log into a remote system bazillions of times (each connection can take several seconds - which adds up when trying several million passwords) but by breaking in and stealing the password file and running the cracker against it on a nice fast machine. #ref/2023/12/09/095245
