- A hidden, self-replicating section of computer software, usually malicious logic, that propagates by infecting - i.e., inserting a copy of itself into and becoming part of - another program. In contrast to a [worm](worm.md), a virus cannot run by itself; it requires that its host program be run to make the virus active. #ref/2023/12/09/101428 #glossary

- Often attaches itself to a host file or the MBR (Master Boot Record) as a parasite. When the host file or MBR is accessed, it activates the virus enabling it to infect other objects. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
- Most viruses spread through human activity within and between computers. #ref/2023/12/09/130055
- A virus is typically designed to damage or destroy data, but different viruses implement their attack at different rates, speeds or targets. For example, some viruses attempt to destroy files on a computer as quickly as possible while others may do so slowly over hours or days. Others might only target images or Word documents (.doc/.docx). #ref/2023/12/09/130055
