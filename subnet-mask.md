# Subnet Mask
- Also known as a netmask. A subnet mask (or number) is used to determine the number of bits used for the subnet and host portions of an IP address. The mask is a 32-bit value that uses one-bits for the network and subnet portions and zero-bits for the host portion. #ref/2023/12/09/101428 #glossary
