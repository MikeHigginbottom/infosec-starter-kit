# Cross Site Scripting
- [XSS](xss.md) is a technique whereby malicious code is injected into otherwise innocent and trusted web sites, allowing the attacker to modify the web page to suit the attacker's objectives. For example extracting data, bypassing other security controls or delivering malicious code for the browser to execute on the userâ€™s computer. #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary
