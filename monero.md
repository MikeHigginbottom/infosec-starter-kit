# Monero
- Monero is a privacy-focused open-source cryptocurrency. It differs from other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin in that all Monero transactions are anonymised. This anonymity, as well as the ability to comfortably mine on CPU resources alone, make Monero a popular choice for cybercriminals. #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary
