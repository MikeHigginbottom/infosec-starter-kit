- Privilege escalation exploits a bug, design flaw or misconfiguration in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. An application with more privileges than intended by the developer or system administrator can perform unauthorised actions. #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary
