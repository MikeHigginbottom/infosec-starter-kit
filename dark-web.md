# Dark Web
- Web content which is both not indexed by conventional search engines and can only be accessed using anonymity tools like the Tor network. #ref/2023/12/09/120659 #glossary

- The dark web should be contrasted with the [deep web](deep-web.md)
- The anonymity provided can be used for both good and bad causes, including protecting communications made by subjects of oppressive regimes or protecting the identity of criminals.   #ref/2023/12/09/120659
